# Eluxi-Player
A GTK based front-end for MPV. A simple media-player project I started to see what it was like and to attempt trying to code in C which I have not done much.

Released here I suppose for myself. This program does indeed work for a media player.

Does it follow best practices, probably not. Has it been fixed to prevent all possible memory leaks, again probably not. 
I am not a professional, I am still working on this project. There are quite a few features and functions I have yet to add.
I am releasing it here so that anyone with better skills and more proper know how could potentially make it a viable use choice!
While I might use it as is...well once I fix it up to include more of the features I would like...many others might not.
Some things are imperfect and or unfinished, rigged to work but not correct in practice. I'm just a hobbyist sorry to dissappoint.
Why am I not making it sound like the ideal choice....idk I suppose I'm not upselling the thing, use it or don't, bothers me none lol just wanted to share it in case.
I thought "Fork it" why not! Punny.

Icons are theme based. The visuals in mine are because I use the BeautySolar icon pack.

Tested on Ubuntu, GNOME.

Current Hotkeys/Bindings
F1,F2,F3,F11,Space,Esc

F1 - F3 are show/hides, F1 attached to the buttons menu, F2 is the duration menu, F3 is the playlist.

Playlist lets you select which media to play and traverse the list. 

Will update the description later.


to run the built version you likely need to: "sudo apt install mpv libgtk-3-0 libglib2.0-0 libx11-6"


to build it yourself likely: "sudo apt install build-essential libmpv-dev libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev libx11-dev"

Currently missing that I am going to add soon, video-track selection/audio-track selection.
