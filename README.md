# Eluxi-Player
A GTK based front-end for MPV. A simple media-player project I started to see what it was like and to attempt trying to code in C which I have not done much.

Released here I suppose for myself. This program does indeed work for a media player.

Does it follow best practices, probably not. Has it been fixed to prevent all possible memory leaks, again probably not. 
I am not a professional, I am still working on this project. There are quite a few features and functions I have yet to add.
I am releasing it here so that anyone with better skills and more proper know how could potentially make it a viable use choice!
While I might use it as is...well once I fix it up to include more of the features I would like...many others might not.
Some things are imperfect and or unfinished, rigged to work but not correct in practice. I'm just a hobbyist sorry to dissappoint.
Why am I not making it sound like the ideal choice....idk I suppose I'm not upselling the thing, use it or don't bother me none just wanted to share it in case.
I thought "Fork it" why not! Punny.
